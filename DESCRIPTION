Description: Provides weighted versions of several metrics and performance
    measures used in machine learning, including average unit deviances of
    the Bernoulli, Tweedie, Poisson, and Gamma distributions, see
    Jorgensen B. (1997, ISBN: 978-0412997112).  The package also contains
    a weighted version of generalized R-squared, see e.g. Cohen, J. et al.
    (2002, ISBN: 978-0805822236).  Furthermore, 'dplyr' chains are
    supported.
