Description: Provides weighted versions of several metrics and
    performance measures used in machine learning, including average unit
    deviances of the Bernoulli, Tweedie, Poisson, and Gamma distributions,
    see e.g. Ohlsson E. and Johansson B. (2015, ISBN: 978-3642107900). The
    package also contains a weighted version of generalized R-squared, see
    e.g. Cohen, Jacob. et al. (2002, ISBN: 978-0805822236). Furthermore,
    'dplyr' chains are supported.
